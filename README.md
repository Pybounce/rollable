# rollable

### Bugs

- [ ] Can jump infinitely against walls because grounded checks touching ground and not raycast
- [ ] Can jump on bouncepads to go way higher

### Enhancements

- [ ] Rename tree_01 to tree_m_01 and then have many that are picked at random to build the stage
- [ ] Sweepers
  - Make the sweeper object just a 1x1 cylinder so it can be scaled to any size
  - Give option to add many sweepers, each placed equal intervals apart
