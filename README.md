# rollable

### Bugs

- [ ] Can jump infinitely against walls because grounded checks touching ground and not raycast
- [ ] Can jump on bouncepads to go way higher

### Enhancements

- [ ] Rename tree_01 to tree_m_01 and then have many that are picked at random to build the stage
- [ ] Sweepers
  - Make the sweeper object just a 1x1 cylinder so it can be scaled to any size
  - Give option to add many sweepers, each placed equal intervals apart

### Audio

- [ ] Bonk sound
  - When the ball collides with something, I can play a bonk sound
  - Volume can depend on velocity before and after collision (velocity change)

### Level Select

- [ ] Isometric 3D
  - Controller a ball that can't jump
  - Rolls around and can enter levels
  - Level buttons are surrounded by the things in them, such as sweepers
  - Similar to a game about cooking or plumbing

### Fun details

- [ ] Air loons
  - Pop if something hits them
